/**
 * A scheduler that chooses threads using a lottery.
 *
 * <p>
 * A lottery scheduler associates a number of tickets with each thread. When a
 * thread needs to be dequeued, a random lottery is held, among all the tickets
 * of all the threads waiting to be dequeued. The thread that holds the winning
 * ticket is chosen.
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that a lottery scheduler must be able to handle a lot of tickets
 * (sometimes billions), so it is not acceptable to maintain state for every
 * ticket.
 *
 * <p>
 * A lottery scheduler must partially solve the priority inversion problem; in
 * particular, tickets must be transferred through locks, and through joins.
 * Unlike a priority scheduler, these tickets add (as opposed to just taking
 * the maximum).
